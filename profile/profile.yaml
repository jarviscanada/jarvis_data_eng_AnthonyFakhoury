# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a recent honors graduate from the University of Toronto. I majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering and double minored in Biomedical Engineering and Engineering Business. I am actively engaged in self-directed initiatives, focusing on Full Stack development, embedded programming and AI.
  I have successfully designed and implemented a variety of projects such as a collection of minor websites and embedded programs. I developed classic arcade games like Brick-Breaker using Verilog and Snakes & Ladders in C and ARM on the DE1-SOC FPGA. Additionally, I created a fully interactive Geo Map using C++. I designed a comprehensive system to generate pressure-based heat maps. My effective communication and leadership skills ensure I can make a positive impact in any project.
  During my nearly 16-month tenure at ADI, I became proficient in multiple coding languages, including C, Python, Doxygen, Yoda, and Jinja. This experience honed my teamwork and time management skills, allowing me to successfully manage multiple concurrent projects, including unit test testing, API development, and an automated code rendering program.
  In essence, this opportunity served as a rigorous training ground that expanded my knowledge across all facets of engineering. My work received accolades from superiors, and I evolved into a reliable team member, offering assistance and guidance to colleagues seeking help with various tasks.

    description: "Engineered a solution aimed at capturing and logging hardware and usage statistics from server hosts into a PostgreSQL database for real-time monitoring and analysis. 
    This system caters primarily to system administrators and IT professionals, facilitating proactive management of server performance and resource utilization. 
    Leveraging Bash scripting, the system automates data collection using common Linux commands (lscpu, vmstat, df) to gather critical hardware details such as CPU architecture, model, speed, and dynamic usage statistics like memory availability and disk space. 
    PostgreSQL serves as the backbone for persistent data storage and management, ensuring robustness in handling collected data. Version control and collaboration are managed through Git, ensuring efficient tracking and management of project iterations. 
    This streamlined approach enhances infrastructure management capabilities, offering a scalable solution for optimizing system performance and enabling informed decision-making through comprehensive monitoring and analysis. 
    Utilizing PostgreSQL and Docker for setup, implementation involves rigorous testing methodologies: manual testing verifies SQL query results, while integration testing ensures compatibility between database schema and queries. 
    Deployment leverages Docker for PostgreSQL instance setup, with GitHub Actions employed for version control and continuous integration. 
    Documentation and progress tracking are managed through a dedicated GitHub repository, ensuring transparency and collaboration throughout the project lifecycle."

         - "JDBC App: Developed a command-line Stock Quote application using Java 21, leveraging JDBC to interact with PostgreSQL and integrating the Alpha Vantage API for real-time stock data. Utilized Maven for dependency management and Docker for containerization. Implemented DAO and Repository design patterns to ensure modularity and maintainability. Conducted thorough testing with JUnit and Mockito to validate CRUD operations and end-to-end functionality. Demonstrated expertise in modern Java features, database interaction, and software testing."
         - "Grep App: Developed a `grep`-like tool in Java to recursively search through files, identify lines matching a regular expression, and write the results to an output file. Implemented two versions: one using traditional Java I/O and another with Java 8 Streams and lambdas. Utilized core Java, SLF4J for logging, Maven for project management, and Docker for containerization. Conducted manual testing by preparing sample data and running various test cases to verify accuracy. Improved application performance by processing files line by line to optimize memory usage. Created a Docker image to facilitate easier distribution and consistent execution across different environments."
