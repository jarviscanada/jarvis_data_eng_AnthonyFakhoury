    description: "Engineered a solution aimed at capturing and logging hardware and usage statistics from server hosts into a PostgreSQL database for real-time monitoring and analysis. This system caters primarily to system administrators and IT professionals, facilitating proactive management of server performance and resource utilization. 
    Leveraging Bash scripting, the system automates data collection using common Linux commands (lscpu, vmstat, df) to gather critical hardware details such as CPU architecture, model, speed, and dynamic usage statistics like memory availability and disk space. PostgreSQL serves as the backbone for persistent data storage and management, ensuring robustness in handling collected data. 
    Version control and collaboration are managed through Git, ensuring efficient tracking and management of project iterations. This streamlined approach enhances infrastructure management capabilities, offering a scalable solution for optimizing system performance and enabling informed decision-making through comprehensive monitoring and analysis."
  - name: "SQL"
    git_url: "/sql"
    description: "Designed to enhance SQL proficiency and prepare for SQL interviews, this project provides hands-on SQL practice for SQL learners and job seekers. The architecture includes database tables for members, bookings, and facilities, utilizing PostgreSQL and Docker for setup. Optional SQL IDEs facilitate query development.
    Implementation involves rigorous testing methodologies:
    Manual testing verifies SQL query results, while integration testing ensures compatibility between database schema and queries. Deployment leverages Docker for PostgreSQL instance setup, with GitHub Actions employed for version control and continuous integration. Documentation and progress tracking are managed through a dedicated GitHub repository, ensuring transparency and collaboration throughout the project lifecycle. 
    This structured approach supports comprehensive skill development in SQL and prepares users for real-world SQL challenges and job requirements."
